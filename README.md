## Multiple Regression Modeling

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook presents a data analysis project focused on analyzing housing prices. The project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing housing prices using a sample dataset.

## Business Understanding

### Introduction

This project aims to use multiple regression models to analyze house sales data, identifying and quantifying the relationships between different factors and house prices. The analysis will uncover the main determinants of house prices, assisting stakeholders in making informed decisions related to real estate investments. For instance, homeowners and sellers can utilize the regression model to estimate their property's value and assess how specific improvements or renovations affect the property's price, enabling them to make well-informed choices about pricing and marketing strategies.

### Problem Statement

This project is all about figuring out the things that really impact house prices. Traditional methods often use guesswork or don't look deep enough, which leads to wrong conclusions. This lack of good information makes it hard for people to predict and understand why house prices go up and down. To solve this, we're using a method called multiple regression. It helps us see how different things are connected to house prices by looking at lots of different factors all at once. This way, we get a much better picture of what's going on.

### Main Objective

To analyze house sales data using multiple regression modeling techniques to identify and quantify the key factors influencing house sales prices and help shareholders make data-driven decisions on investing in real estate.

### General Objectives

1. Conduct explanatory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and the target variable, assisting in the selection of relevant variables for the regression model.
2. Develop a multiple regression model to predict house sale prices, considering the selected independent variables and their impact on the dependent variable. Validate the model assumptions, assess its goodness of fit, and refine the model if necessary.
3. Interpret the coefficients of the independent variables in the model to determine their individual impact on house prices, identifying the most influential factors driving the house sales prices and their respective effects.
4. Evaluate and validate the performance of the model.
5. Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis to assist real estate investors and policymakers in making informed decisions regarding property investment, market trends, and economic planning.

## Data Understanding

### Data Source

The dataset used in this project contains information about the factors affecting housing prices, including variables such as date, sqft_above, view, and sqft_basement. Explanatory data analysis will be used to get a clear understanding of the dataset, including handling missing values, checking the data types, identifying outliers, and extracting relevant features for analysis.

### Data Cleaning

- Data was loaded using Pandas.
- The dataset was previewed for initial understanding.
- Explanatory data analysis was conducted.
- Categorical columns in the data were encoded.
- Date types were formatted for analysis.

### Feature Engineering

- Features were selected for the regression model.
- Data was scaled for modeling.
- Data was split into training and testing sets.

## Regression Model

### Baseline Model

The baseline model was established, and model iterations were performed to refine the analysis.

### Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared Score, were used to assess the model's performance.

## Limitations

- Missing Data: If there are missing values in the dataset, the regression model may not handle them well by default. Missing data can introduce bias and affect the accuracy of the model's predictions.
- Outliers: Outliers in the data can significantly influence the regression model's results. If there are influential outliers, they can affect the estimated coefficients and decrease the model's predictive accuracy.
- Linearity Assumption: The regression model assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the target variable. If the relationship is non-linear, the model may not capture the underlying pattern accurately.
- Multicollinearity: Highly correlated independent variables can lead to multicollinearity, affecting the stability and reliability of the regression coefficients.

## Recommendations & Conclusions

- Feature Enhancement: Consider enhancing or upgrading features that positively affect house prices, such as increasing square footage or improving property grade.
- Feature Importance: Focus on features with higher coefficients, such as 'sqft_living', 'grade', 'bathrooms', and 'sqft_above', as they have a stronger impact on predicted prices.
- Price Prediction: Utilize the regression model to predict house prices based on the given set of independent variables.
- Data Collection: Consider collecting additional relevant data to improve the accuracy of the regression model.
- Market Segmentation: Analyze the relationship between independent variables and house prices to identify market segments or specific buyer preferences.
