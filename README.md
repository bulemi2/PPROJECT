## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook presents a data analysis project focused on analyzing housing prices. The project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing housing prices using a sample dataset.

### Target Audience
 
This data is of interest to a diverse set of stakeholders, including real estate agencies ,properties investors, homeowners, home sellers  and anyone keen on gaining insights into the housing market to help in making investment decisions.

# Business Understanding

# Introduction

This project aims to use multiple regression models to analyze house sales data, identifying and quantifying the relationships between different factors and house prices. The analysis will uncover the main determinants of house prices, assisting stakeholders in making informed decisions related to real estate investments. For instance, homeowners and sellers can utilize the regression model to estimate their property's value and assess how specific improvements or renovations affect the property's price, enabling them to make well-informed choices about pricing and marketing strategies.

# Problem Statement

This project is all about figuring out the things that really impact house prices. Traditional methods often use guesswork or don't look deep enough, which leads to wrong conclusions. This lack of good information makes it hard for people to predict and understand why house prices go up and down. To solve this, we're using a method called multiple regression. It helps us see how different things are connected to house prices by looking at lots of different factors all at once. This way, we get a much better picture of what's going on.

# Main Objective

To analyze house sales data using multiple regression modeling techniques to identify and quantify the key factors influencing house sales prices and help shareholders make data-driven decisions on investing in real estate.

# General Objectives

1. Conduct explanatory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between different variables and the target variable, assisting in the selection of relevant variables for the regression model.
2. Develop a multiple regression model to predict house sale prices, considering the selected independent variables and their impact on the dependent variable. Validate the model assumptions, assess its goodness of fit, and refine the model if necessary.
3. Interpret the coefficients of the independent variables in the model to determine their individual impact on house prices, identifying the most influential factors driving the house sales prices and their respective effects.
4. Evaluate and validate the performance of the model.
5. Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis to assist real estate investors and policymakers in making informed decisions regarding property investment, market trends, and economic planning.

# Data Understanding


The dataset used in this project contains information about the factors affecting housing prices, including variables such as date, sqft_above, view, and sqft_basement. Explanatory data analysis will be used to get a clear understanding of the dataset, including handling missing values, checking the data types, identifying outliers, and extracting relevant features for analysis.

# Results and interpretation

### Baseline Model:

 Mean Squared Error (MSE)

 The baseline model has a testing MSE of 0.0169, which signifies that its predictions have an average squared difference of approximately 0.0169 from the actual values. While this MSE is relatively low, it's higher than the Random Forest model's MSE.
 R-squared (R2) Score
The R-squared score for the baseline model is 0.6658, indicating that it explains around 66.58% of the variance in the target variable. This suggests a decent fit to the data, but there's still unexplained variance.

### Random Forest Regression Model

 Mean Squared Error (MSE)

 The Random Forest Regression model outperforms the baseline with a lower testing MSE of 0.0101. This indicates that the Random Forest model's predictions are, on average, closer to the actual values, which is a strong indicator of predictive accuracy.
R-squared (R2) Score 

The Random Forest Regression model have a higher R-squared score of 0.8201, signifying that it explains approximately 82.01% of the variance in the target variable. This is a substantially higher R-squared score compared to the baseline model.

The Random Forest Regression model demonstrates superior performance in terms of predictive accuracy compared to the baseline model. It achieves lower MSE and higher R-squared, which indicates that it provides more accurate and reliable predictions and explains a larger portion of the variance in the data.
The baseline model shows reasonable performance, but there's room for improvement, as indicated by a moderate R-squared score and a slightly higher MSE. It captures a portion of the variance in the data, but the Random Forest model excels in this regard.
The Random Forest model's results are particularly promising, making it a more robust and accurate choice for making predictions based on the provided metrics
## Conclusions

1.Model Accuracy: The model's performance is good, as indicated by a low Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0101. This low MSE reflects that, on average, the model's predictions are in close proximity to the actual values, which is a strong indicator of its predictive accuracy.

2.Prediction Consistency: The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.1005 reveals that the model's predictions have a typical error of approximately 0.1005 units in the same scale as the target variable. This consistency implies that the model's predictions are reliable and stable across different instances, which is vital for decision-making.

3.High Explained Variance: The R-squared (R2) score of 0.8201 is a notable achievement, suggesting that the model explains approximately 82.01% of the variance in the target variable. This high R2 score signifies that the model effectively captures a significant portion of the variation in the data, indicating a strong fit to the observed outcomes.

4.Model Effectiveness: The model's ability to make accurate predictions, as evidenced by the low MSE and RMSE, coupled with its capability to explain a substantial portion of the variance in the target variable (high R2), demonstrates its effectiveness in addressing the prediction task at hand.
